# Hoofhisser Trait Cost Calculator

A calculator designed to find the cheapest cost, to make your Hoofhisser, based on their traits.

## Description

Before you can make your Hoofhisser official, you must buy the correct items to account for all of their traits. This is why I'm building this calculator so members will be easily able to find how to cheaply make their Hoofhisser's official. With over 3500+ Hoofhissers on the masterlist now, there is no shortage of people looking to make their characters a part of the species.
